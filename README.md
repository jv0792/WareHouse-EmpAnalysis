# WareHouse-EmpAnalysis : Summary

The project showcases Data Analysis skills using MySQL, the ‘mintclassics’ database provided by Coursera. 
This project covers a wide range of KPIs being measured including Total Revenue, Average Order Value as a part of financial metrics, inventory management (inventory turnover ratio, days inventory outstanding), customer analysis and other operational matrices such as order fulfilment rate, sales per employee, and the order status. These matrices will help monitor, evaluate and improve business performance.

# Project Scenario

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities.

# Business problem:
To make a data-driven decision on closing one of their storage facilities while ensuring continued timely service to customers. 

The specific objectives are:
**1. Reorganizing or Reducing Inventory**: To identify ways to manage and reduce the current inventory without impacting the ability to ship products to customers within 24 hours of an order being placed.

**2. Maintaining Timely Service**: To ensure that any changes to the storage or inventory management do not affect the company's service level agreement with customers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Approach :**
To address this business challenge, I will:

1. Explore Current Inventory: Analyze the products currently stored in our facilities to understand their storage locations, inventory levels, and sales performance.

2. Identify Key Influencing Factors: Determine factors impacting inventory reorganization or reduction, such as sales trends, inventory turnover, and storage costs.

3. Provide Data-Driven Recommendations: Offer suggestions based on analytical insights to reduce or reorganize inventory effectively.

I will answer the following specific questions through SQL queries:

1. Storage Locations: Where are items stored, and if rearranged, could we eliminate a warehouse?

2. Inventory and Sales Relationship: How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Are the inventory counts appropriate for each item?

3. Non-Moving Items: Are there items that are not selling and could be candidates for removal from the product line?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**My exploratory data analysis will involve:**

Importing and analyzing the provided database to uncover patterns and themes relevant to inventory management.
Using SQL queries to extract meaningful data and insights.
Sharing my findings to support the decision-making process for closing a storage facility while maintaining efficient customer service.
